# Capstone Project
This is my Digital Futures Capstone project where I explore the age-old question, "Are we alone in the Universe?"
Looking into the data that we have to try to answer such a question, how we are gathering that data and the data we aim to gather in the future
At the start I explore my motivations and the motivations of humankinds intrigue into this question
Throughout the main body of the presentation I walk through the techniques being used to collect data on the subject matter and how this may look in the future.
At the end I wrap up by explaining what I was able to take from the research that I had done and my own thoughts on the question.
